## About

To build the mini project I used redux instead of state in React as it was shown in [Mosh tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0).  

> These are my first steps with Redux.  

I used basic concepts of redux following [Redux For Beginners | React Redux Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY). This is the best tutorial on Redux which I have seen till now. 🎉 🎁

## Also I built clear Git history
